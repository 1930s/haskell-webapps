Summary and Conclusion
========================


Why and when you should use HRR in a live system
--------------------------------------------------

[Describe what use scenario HRRs handles best; outline the benefits:
 type safety of queries defined in Haskell and type checking of queries against the DB schema; avoiding boilerplate]


Drawbacks you might be in for
------------------------------

[HRRs limitation to the base cases, as per decision of the authors; sometimes clumsy
 syntax; need for a complete and running DB backend to build Haskell project;
 while HRR entry-level docs are quite good, lack of mid-level documentation
 and reference examples becomes obvious later on]



(some more paragraphs that should form part of a summary / conclusion?)
