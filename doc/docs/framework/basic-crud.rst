Basic CRUD Operations with models

--------------------

Once you've generated your models using :doc:`the migration tool <./migrations>` you'll notice a lot of files getting auto-generated in the ``<projectRoot>/autogen` directory, namely:

Try the following in your REPL:

.. code:: haskell

   createModel
