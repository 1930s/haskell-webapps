Basic CRUD Operations with models
=================================

Model code-generator
--------------------

Once you've generated your models using :doc:`the migration tool <./migrations>` you'll notice a lot of files getting auto-generated in the ``<projectRoot>/autogen`` directory:

#. For every table that your DB contains you'll have an auto-generated model called ``AutoGenerated.Models.<SingularizedTableNameInCamelCase>``. 
#. For every table that has a primary key called ``id`` (which is a recommended convention), you'll have an auto-generated module called ``AutoGenerated.PrimaryKeys.<ModelName>Id``
#. For every **unique** column name across all your tables, you'll have an auto-generated lens class called ``AutoGenerated.Classes.Has<FieldNameInCamelCase>``

For example, if you have the following two tables in your DB schema:

==========      ==========
Users           Posts
==========      ==========
id              id
created_at      created_at
updated_at      updated_at
email           
password
first_name
last_name
==========      ==========


Try the following in your REPL:

.. code:: haskell

   createModel
